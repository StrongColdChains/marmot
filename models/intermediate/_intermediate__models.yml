    description: > 
      A view into whether a time series row has been considered as being part of a temperature alarm.
      This view could also be seen as a tool to turn time series data into alarm time series data, where
      each row sent by an EMD also has information about whether an alarm is active.
    columns:
      - name: cce_id
        data_type: text
      - name: created_at
        description: "When the time series data was measured by the monitor"
        data_type: timestamp
      - name: minutes_since_previous_datapoint
        description: "The minutes since the previous datapoint was created for a given cce_id + monitor_id"
        data_type: float
      - name: threshold_is_crossed
        description: "A flag to determine whether the alarm threshold is crossed by this datapoint"
        data_type: boolean

        description: "used to track whether our cumulative tracker needs to be reset"
        data_type: integer
      - name: cumulative_minutes
        description: "How long the threshold has been crossed"
        data_type: integer
