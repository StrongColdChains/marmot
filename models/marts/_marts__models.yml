    description: >
        KPIs defined for base station connectivity. All data points
        sent by the base station in the last 30 days are considered.
        Note that received_at is referenced for determining the last
        30 days, not created_at.
    columns:
      - name: monitor_id
        description: The monitor for these KPIs.
      - name: cumulative_lateness
        description: >
          The sum of all the lateness for the datapoints sent by this
          monitor in the last 30 days. A large value for this implies
          either that there are many datapoints sent by that base station
          that were late, or there were a smaller number that were
          very late.
      - name: average_lateness
        description: >
          The average amount of lateness for datapoints sent by this
          base station
      - name: max_lateness
        description: >
          The largest amount of lateness for datapoints sent by this
          base station. This basically amounts to the largest
          connectivity outage experienced by this base station in the
          last 30 days.
