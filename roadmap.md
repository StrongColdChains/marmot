# Roadmap

A vague list of things that we'd like to do in the near future.

## technical things

- Refactor temperature intervals + alarms. See alarm_thoughts.md for more deets.
- Implement ACK as time series data!
- add sim signal strength
  - "Cell signal strength typically ranges from -50 dBm to -120 dBm"
  - if a device goes offline and the previous few days of signal strength are really
      bad, then we can attribute the offline to sim connectivity.
- Implement door / power kpis.
- Implement functional status of appliance, uptime score.
  - let's not just make functional status a bool. let's change it to a float so that
      we can provide a more nuanced understanding of the appliance's health.
- Create basic metrics that assess the health of the underlying CCE.
  - pull out things like the range of the temperature wave. rate of temp increase.
  - see if the average temperature of the cce is consistently drifting low
    -     - https://github.com/facebookresearch/Kats/blob/main/tutorials/kats_202_detection.ipynb
  - ideally, this metric should be resilient to power-outage related temperature excursions.
- Make a stab at categorizing *why* excursions happen. power outage? door left open?
  - first, just look at a CCEs other data sources.
  - then, look at the facility its in
- metabase is a self-serve BI tool. Get it working on top of our postgres database.
- start to write some data generation tools. Look at timescale's tsbs tool for inspiration.
- create a tool for imputing missing data. integrate it into the dbt dag.
- write a CCE report with latex. this report should be useful for a CCE repair person on-site.
  - contains all relevant KPIs for the CCE.
  - highlights all *points of interest* in the last X days in a graph.
  - should be able to handle arbitrary numbers of days.
  - appendix should contain all relevant info that we have on the CCE.
- actually set up tests in a good way??? don't understand dbt's testing framework yet.
- define a data model for devices, cces, facilities, and arbitrary groupings of cces.
  - facilities should be implemented as an arbitrary grouping of cces. it's a special case.
  - make a distinction between a sensor and a base station. sensors pick up temps, base stations
      send the data to the central server. a single piece of hardware can be both a sensor and
      a base station. but some aren't! might be useful to make distinctions between a cce going
      offline because of a base station (sim connectivity issues) vs a sensor (bluetooth / wire issues).
- define reasonable KPIs for arbitrary groupings of cces. ðŸ˜ˆ this is where things get
    interesting / challenging.
- settle on a technology for visualizing time series data.
- figure out a story for performance monitoring + load testing.
- hook up https://github.com/plmercereau/chat-dbt to postgres! woo! cool! ai for cheap :p

## communication / writing / education things

- explain the types of actions we're trying to support.
  - equipment procurement. what types of equipment perform well in the field?
  - cce maintenance, when someone goes into the field do they have *easy* access to relevant data?
  - device procurement. what types of devices perform well in the field?
  - assessing the success of cold chain data programs. how well are the contextual databases being maintaned?
  - where are vaccines getting the most damage in the chain?
- explain the difference between created_at and received_at.
- explain the different domains that all need to go right for data to be properly interpreted.
- explain the weaknesses of E006/DS01.2, lots of improvements possible :D
- write some pieces showing off the value of various metrics (ideally, publish it when you
    implement said metric within our system).
- come up with a cute little mascot for this project : )

## misc

- think about the unique challenges that wic and wifs present. these store tons of vaccines, what
    can we do to improve their performance?
- is there any way we can measure the effectiveness of device setups? For devices that operate over
    wires, is there any way for us to know if a configuration is bad?
