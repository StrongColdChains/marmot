# DS01.2 notes

I'm reading through the "Data objects corresponding to DS01.2" spreadsheet.


the data object notes imply that a device is located specifically
in a region, district, and facility. this has (good) implications
for the data model.


"holdover, autonomy, or independence time" - sensors / data analysis.
huh, they really care about this but don't seem to lay out any
way to calculate it. probably should give it a stab.
